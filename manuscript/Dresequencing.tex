\section*{Background}
The American diploid “D-genome” cottons (subgenus \textit{Houzingenia}) comprise a monophyletic clade of cytogenetically and morphologically distinct species largely distributed from Southwest Mexico to Arizona, with additional disjunct species distributions in Peru and the Galapagos Islands \note[Corrinne]{which citations here, Endrizzi et al 1985}. Among the 13 species currently included in the D-genome \note[Corrinne]{although see Ulloa 2013} are\textit{G. harknessii} (D2-2), an important species for cytoplasmic male sterility in cotton, and \textit{G. raimondii} (D5), the model diploid progenitor to wild and domesticated allopolyploid cotton \note[Corrinne]{Endrizzi 1985, others?}. The close relationship of \textit{Houzingenia} species to the agronomically important polyploids, combined with the relative ease of sampling this subgenus for early cotton taxonomists, facilitated much of the current understanding of the relationships among D-genome species. 

These early taxonomists divided subgenus \textit{Houzingenia} into two sections and six subsections, whose species alliances have largely been retained by subsequent phylogenetic studies \note[Corrinne]{Cronn et al., 1996; Seelanan et al., 1997; Small and Wendel, 2000b; Wendel and Albert, 1992; Wendel et al., 1995b; alvarez 2005}. Several molecular datasets have been used to evaluate these relationships, including chloroplast restriction sites \note[Corrinne]{citation}; simple sequence repeat (SSR) and expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR markers \note[Corrinne]{citation}; random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers \note[Corrinne]{citation}; internal transcribed sequences (ITS) \note[Corrinne]{citation}; and few single-copy nuclear genes \note[Corrinne]{citation}. Relationships among the six subsections, however, remain unclear despite numerous, and often conflicting, studies \note[Corrinne]{Cronn et al., 1996; Liu et al., 2001b; Small and Wendel, 2000b more citations}. Determining the closest living relative of the D-genome ancestor to the polyploid, however, has been met with greater success. Early morphological and cytogenetic comparisons using intergenomic hybrids quickly identified \textit{G. raimondii} as the closest living relative to the D-genome ancestor of polyploid cotton species \note[Corrinne]{Stephens, 1944b Hutchinson et al., 1945, 1947 ; Gerstel and Phillips, 1958; Phillips, 1964; reviewed in Wendel and Cronn 2003}. Subsequent analyses have largely supported this observation (Abdalla et al., 2001; cronn 1999, liu 2001, Cronn et al., 1996 Seelanan et al., 1997 Small et al., 1998; Small and Wendel, 2000a,b), with few conflicts \note[Corrinne]{see, however Wendel et al., 1995b; I know there are others…. What are they?}.
